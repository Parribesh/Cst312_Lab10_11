  - Had some problems with python 3.10 therefore reinstalled python3.8 and installed google cloud package.
  - ran script from the command prompt and added reasons for my VM which was little confusing at first.
  - got errors about not having set billing information, figured out eventually that I was using wrong gmail account.
